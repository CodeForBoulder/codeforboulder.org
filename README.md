# codeforboulder.org

This is where we will eventually host the Code for Boulder site.

It's built with [Jekyll][jekyll], a static web generator.

This is a work in progress! View the current site here:

### <http://codeforboulder.github.io/codeforboulder.org/>


## Making Changes:

Read a little about [Jekyll][jekyll] if you need an introduction. Basically markdown pages (like `index.markdown`) have simple plain-text content in them that gets turned into a webpage, using a 'template' or 'layout'.


### Front End:

To change the basic html of the whole site, edit the files in the `_layouts` directory.

Add any javascript libraries, or css to the `assets` directory.


### Content

All the page copy are in simple markdown files
